    <h1> About Me </h1>

    <P>I was born and raised in Chile, spent two years in Montreal, and have been in Ottawa for almost three years. I've enjoyed doing different types of art since I was a kid, and naturally, I spent most of my free time sketching and painting. Recently, this developed into a fascination for painting murals and studying/practicing graphic design. I also enjoy doing martial arts such as Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu when possible and listening to music bands such as Radiohead and Woodkid. 
    </p>
    
    <P>Many factors influenced me to choose the Graphic Design program, and some of the designers I've admired for a while and who inspired me are Mad Bergs, Saul Bass, and Lester Beall. Their works are incredible, some of them with lots of details and others incredibly simplistic but effective. Although the future of Graphic Design may not be the brightest right now, 
    I believe the future will offer new tools and ways for us to implement our knowledge.
